<p><span class="newthought">I‚Äôm a Michigan man.</span>  I was born and raised in the ‚Äúthumb‚Äù area of the Great Lakes state and have been cheering for the University of Michigan since childhood, long before I became an undergraduate there. Although it‚Äôs hard to complain about the idyllic weather in California, I do sometimes miss the dramatic Michigan seasons, which broke up the year into such distinct periods.</p>

<p>I discovered math in elementary school, when I was given a test to see if I would qualify for a ‚Äútalented and gifted‚Äù program. I remember asking asking why some of the numbers had exclamation marks and what that meant. Thus was my first encounter with factorials. It was a glimpse of math beyond basic arithmetic and I found it fascinating. But I was also interested in physics and chemistry, and I envisioned becoming some type of ‚Äúmad scientist‚Äù when I grew up, creating exotic techologies like portals and anti-gravity machines.</p>

<p>I arrived at the University of Michigan fully expecting to major in math and physics (and maybe also chemistry), but I quickly discovered a strong preference for the theoretical over the practical. Also, I hated units.</p>

I took every number theory class I could at Michigan before heading off to graduate school at Stanford to learn even more. However, during my second year at Stanford I got my first taste of algebraic geometry and have been hooked on the subject ever since. Working with <a href="http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/">Professor Ravi Vakil</a>, my thesis focused on the study of a special class of geometric objects known as \(S_3\)-covers of schemes.</p>

<p>After graduating from Stanford, I held a three-year <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/vigre/">VIGRE</a> postdoctoral position at the University of Utah. During my time there I began studying a new offshoot of algebraic geometry known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_geometry">tropical geometry</a>. In the fall of 2008 I spent a quarter visiting the University of Washington at the invitation of <a href="https://sites.math.washington.edu/~kovacs/current/">Professor Sandor Kovacs</a>, and in the spring of 2009 I spent a semester at <a href="http://www.msri.org/">MSRI</a>.</p>

<p>I finished my position at Utah in the spring of 2011, and in the fall of that year I began a tenure-track position at California Polytechnic State University (‚ÄúCal Poly‚Äù) in San Luis Obipso (‚ÄúSLO‚Äù). I continue to work on problems in tropical geometry whenever I have the chance. I also enjoy working with talented undergraduates, not only on projects in tropical geometry but also in number theory and category theory. You can read about those projects over on my <a href="/blog/page/teaching">Teaching</a> page.</p>

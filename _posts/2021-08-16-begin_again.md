Perhaps that should be our motto this year. With the pandemic possibly winding down and in-person classes set to resume, it seems it's finally time to start working our way back to normal. In my case, that also means rebuilding my website, having recently discovered it transformed into a smoking heap of rubble...<!--more-->

Sometime over the course of the pandemic there was a [massive data breach](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/257016/20210212/wordpress-data-breach-affects-100-000-exposed-websites-using-responsive.htm) at WordPress. This news didn't reach me at the time, probably because I wasn't thinking about my website at all. Not only was I buried knee-deep in Canvas running virtual courses, my second child was also days away from being born. So checking my Wordpress site never once crossed my mind.

Fast forward to a week ago, when I start thinking about Fall quarter and decide to check out [my old site](http://www.robertweaston.com/). Yikes. I spent a few hours poking around the ashes to see if I could easily fix the damage, but eventually I came to the conclusion that it wasn't worth the effort. The site had been feeling a bit stale and needed an overhaul anyway, so this seemed like as good a time as any to start over fresh. To quote Normon Juster:

I spent the last week learning abot [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I've also tracked down this lovely [Tufte-style theme](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll). Now all that remains is the real work: putting up content. I plan to make this a home for everything I'm working on, from serious research to fun diversions. So let's get to it!

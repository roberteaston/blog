<p><span class="newthought">I’m a Michigan man.</span>  I was born and raised in the “thumb” area of the Great Lakes state and have been cheering for the University of Michigan since childhood, long before I became an undergraduate there. Although it’s hard to complain about the idyllic weather in California, I do sometimes miss the dramatic Michigan seasons, which broke up the year into such distinct periods. Just look at some of this scenery:</p>

<p>I discovered math in elementary school, when I was given a test to see if I would qualify for a “talented and gifted” program. I remember asking asking why some of the numbers had exclamation marks and what that meant. Thus was my first encounter with factorials. It was a glimpse of math beyond basic arithmetic and I found it fascinating. But I was also interested in physics and chemistry, and I envisioned becoming some type of “mad scientist” when I grew up, creating exotic techologies like portals and anti-gravity machines.</p>

<p>I arrived at the University of Michigan fully expecting to major in math and physics (and maybe also chemistry), but I quickly discovered a strong preference for the theoretical over the practical. Also, I hated units. It seems I wasn’t alone:</p>

<p><label for="id-ravi" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="id-ravi" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/blog/assets/img/vakil.jpg" /><br />Ravi Vakil is one of only eight people to become a Putnam Fellow four times.</span>In any case, my interests quickly focused on the more theoretical subjects, especially number theory. I took every number theory class I could at Michigan, before heading off to graduate school at Stanford to learn even more. However, during my second year at Stanford I got my first taste of algebraic geometry and have been hooked on the subject ever since. Working with <a href="http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/">Professor Ravi Vakil</a>, my thesis focused on the study of a special class of geometric objects known as \(S_3\)-covers of schemes.</p>

<p>After graduating from Stanford, I held a three-year <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/vigre/">VIGRE</a> postdoctoral position at the University of Utah. During my time there, I began studying a new offshoot of algebraic geometry known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_geometry">tropical geometry</a>. In the fall of 2008 I spent a quarter visiting the University of Washington at the invitation of <a href="https://sites.math.washington.edu/~kovacs/current/">Professor Sandor Kovacs</a>, and in the spring of 2009 I spent a semester at <a href="http://www.msri.org/">MSRI</a>.</p>

<p>I finished my position at Utah in the spring of 2011, and in the fall of that year I began a tenure-track position at California Polytechnic State University (“Cal Poly”) in San Luis Obipso (“SLO”). I continue to work on problems in tropical geometry whenever I have the chance. I also enjoy working with talented undergraduates, not only on projects in tropical geometry but also in number theory and category theory. You can read about those projects over on my <a href="/blog/page/teaching">Teaching</a> page.</p>

{% newthought "I'm a Michigan man."%} I was born and raised in the "thumb" area of the Great Lakes state and have been cheering for the University of Michigan since childhood, long before I became an undergraduate there. Although it's hard to complain about the idyllic weather in California, I do sometimes miss the dramatic Michigan seasons, which broke up the year into such distinct periods.

I discovered math in elementary school, when I was given a test to see if I would qualify for a "talented and gifted" program. I remember asking asking why some of the numbers had exclamation marks and what that meant. Thus was my first encounter with factorials. It was a glimpse of math beyond basic arithmetic and I found it fascinating. But I was also interested in physics and chemistry, and I envisioned becoming some type of "mad scientist" when I grew up, creating exotic techologies like portals and anti-gravity machines.

I arrived at the University of Michigan fully expecting to major in math and physics (and maybe also chemistry), but I quickly discovered a strong preference for the theoretical over the practical. Also, I hated units.

I took every number theory class I could at Michigan before heading off to graduate school at Stanford to learn even more. However, during my second year at Stanford I got my first taste of algebraic geometry and have been hooked on the subject ever since. Working with [Professor Ravi Vakil](http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/), my thesis focused on the study of a special class of geometric objects known as $$S_3$$-covers of schemes.

After graduating from Stanford, I held a three-year [VIGRE](http://www.math.utah.edu/vigre/) postdoctoral position at the University of Utah. During my time there I began studying a new offshoot of algebraic geometry known as [tropical geometry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_geometry). In the fall of 2008 I spent a quarter visiting the University of Washington at the invitation of [Professor Sandor Kovacs](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~kovacs/current/), and in the spring of 2009 I spent a semester at [MSRI](http://www.msri.org/).

I finished my position at Utah in the spring of 2011, and in the fall of that year I began a tenure-track position at California Polytechnic State University (“Cal Poly”) in San Luis Obipso (“SLO”). I continue to work on problems in tropical geometry whenever I have the chance. I also enjoy working with talented undergraduates, not only on projects in tropical geometry but also in number theory and category theory. You can read about those projects over on my [Teaching]({% link page/teaching.md %}) page.

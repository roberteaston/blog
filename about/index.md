{% marginfigure "id-michigan" "assets/img/michigan.png" "An elevation map of Michigan ([source](https://muir-way.com/products/michigan-elevation-map))" %}{% newthought "I'm a Michigan man."%} I was born and raised in the "thumb" area of the Great Lakes state and have been cheering for the University of Michigan since childhood, long before I became an undergraduate there. Although it's hard to complain about the idyllic weather in California, I do sometimes miss the dramatic Michigan seasons, which broke up the year into such distinct periods. I'll probably always associate the start of the school year with that crisp fall air and panolply of colors, just as I'll associate winter break with fresh snow, cold wind, and hunkering down indoors by a warm fire.

{% newthought "I discovered math"%} sometime around 5<sup>th</sup> grade, but I didn't originally think I would become a mathematician. I was also interested in physics and chemistry, and throughout high school I would tell people that I wanted to be a "mad scientist" when I grew up. I always imagined that would involve creating exotic techologies, like portals and anti-gravity machines. I arrived at the University of Michigan fully expecting to major in math and physics (and maybe also chemistry), but I quickly discovered a strong preference for the theoretical over the practical. Also, I hated units. Nothing could get my blood boiling faster than the declaration "We'll set our units so that the speed of light is one." And I know I'm not the only one who felt that way.

{% epigraph 'For those who want some proof that physicists are human, the proof is in the idiocy of all the different units which they use for measuring energy.' 'Richard P. Feynmann' '"The Character of Physical Law"' %}

In any case, my interests quickly focused on the more theoretical subjects, especially number theory.

{% marginfigure "id-ravi" "assets/img/vakil.jpg" "Ravi Vakil is one of only eight people to become a Putnam Fellow four times." %}{% newthought "After graduating from Michigan,"%} I moved out to sunny California to attend graduate school at Stanford. I arrived expecting to specialize in number theory, but during my second year I got my first taste of algebraic geometry and have been hooked on the subject ever since. Working with [Professor Ravi Vakil](http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/), my thesis focused on the study of a special class of geometric objects known as $$S_3$$-covers of schemes.

{% newthought "After graduating from Stanford,"%} I held a three-year [VIGRE](http://www.math.utah.edu/vigre/) postdoctoral position at the University of Utah. During my time there, I began studying a new offshoot of algebraic geometry known as [tropical geometry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_geometry). In the fall of 2008 I spent a quarter visiting the University of Washington at the invitation of [Professor Sandor Kovacs](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~kovacs/current/), and in the spring of 2009 I spent a semester at [MSRI](http://www.msri.org/).

{% newthought "I finished my position at Utah"%} in the spring of 2011, and in the fall of that year I began a tenure-track position at California Polytechnic State University (“Cal Poly”) in San Luis Obipso (“SLO”). I continue to work on problems in tropical geometry and recently wrapped up a project in the subject with [Professor Aaron Betram](http://www.math.utah.edu/~bertram/). I have also begun enticing talented students to work with me on interesting undergraduate research problems. With any luck, I will have Cal Poly churning out legions of algebraic geometers by the end of the decade.

{% marginfigure "margin-figure-id" "assets/img/michigan.png" "The Upper and Lower Peninsulas." %}{% newthought "I'm a Michigan man."%} I was born and raised in the "thumb" of the Great Mitten state. I've been cheering for U of M since childhood, long before I became an undergraduate there. I actually miss the weather, with its dramatic seasons which broke up the year into such distinct periods. The colored leaves and crisp air of Fall, when the new school year had begun and everything was promise and potential. The darkness and biting cold of Winter, a time of introspection interspersed with holiday revelry. And then Spring! All rejoiced as the thaw broke and sun shone warmly once more. Finally the slow build towards Summer, filled with hot days, cool drinks, relaxation, and adventure.

Not that I can really complain about the idyllic weather in SLO...

{% marginfigure "margin-figure-id" "assets/img/michigan.png" "The Upper and Lower Peninsulas." %}{% newthought "I'm a Michigan man."%} I was born and raised in the "thumb" of the Great Mitten state. I've been cheering for [U of M](https://umich.edu/) since childhood, long before I became an undergraduate there. Although it's hard to complain about the idyllic weather in SLO, I do sometimes miss the dramatic Michigan seasons, which broke up the year into such distinct periods. The colored leaves and crisp air of Fall, when the new school year had begun and everything was promise and potential. The darkness and biting cold of Winter, a time of introspection interspersed with holiday revelry. Spring, when the thaw broke and the sun shone warmly once more. And finally the slow build towards Summer, filled with hot days, cool drinks, relaxation, and adventure.

{% newthought "After graduating from Michigan,"%} I moved out to sunny California to attend graduate school at Stanford. I arrived expecting to specialize in number theory, but during my second year I got my first taste of algebraic geometry and have been hooked on the subject ever since. Working with [Professor Ravi Vakil](http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/), my thesis focused on the study of a special class of geometric objects known as S_3-covers of schemes.

{% newthought "After graduating from Stanford,"%} I held a three-year [VIGRE](http://www.math.utah.edu/vigre/) postdoctoral position at the University of Utah. During my time there, I began studying a new offshoot of algebraic geometry known as [tropical geometry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_geometry). In the fall of 2008 I spent a quarter visiting the University of Washington at the invitation of [Professor Sandor Kovacs](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~kovacs/current/), and in the spring of 2009 I spent a semester at [MSRI](http://www.msri.org/).

{% newthought "I finished my position at Utah"%} in the spring of 2011, and in the fall of that year I began a tenure-track position at California Polytechnic State University (“Cal Poly”) in San Luis Obipso (“SLO”). I continue to work on problems in tropical geometry and recently wrapped up a project in the subject with [Professor Aaron Betram](http://www.math.utah.edu/~bertram/). I have also begun enticing talented students to work with me on interesting undergraduate research problems. With any luck, I will have Cal Poly churning out legions of algebraic geometers by the end of the decade.
